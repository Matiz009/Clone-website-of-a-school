                     <p style="font-size: 15px;">Any school of the Congregation of Jesus & 

                        Mary exists to serve you.

                       Our role is to cooperate with you in helping your daughter to become a

                       creative person in the contemporary world. Together with you, we try and

                       help your daughter realize that ultimately it is she who must make herself.

                       By her personal choices and actions, she will form herself into a responsible

                       person. Together we will help her to develop her powers of body and soul,

                       her emotions, imagination, intellect and her unique potential for social

                       relationship. In brief, we hope that your daughter will see her life as

                       one of dynamic growth and personal service to Almighty God and to the

                       whole family of humankind. At the time your daughter leaves school, we 

                       hope the following characteristics will be hers;</p>

                       <h3>Values;</h3>

                       <p style="font-size: 15px;">These will have been instilled

                         in her throughout her school life and

                         will motivate and permeate all her choices, her decisions in the future.

                         They will have moulded her into a caring, realistic human being who is
                         
                         concerned about others. In short, these values will have made of her an 

                         ‘other-centred person’, a person prepared to take risks and face challenges

                          for the betterment of the society where she finds herself.</p>
    
                          <h3>Knowledge;</h3>
                          <p style="font-size: 15px;">She will have gained that experiential knowledge
                           which is necessary for the next stage of her life. This means that she will
                           have grasped the arts and sciences to the extent of her potential. She will 
                           have knowledge of her Faith equal to her potential in other fields and strong
                           enough to counter pressures that may arise in her adult life. She will know
                           about her own society, world societies, and her responsibility to these 
                            societies.

                        <h3>Skills;</h3>
                         <p style="font-size: 15px;">Your daughter will also have acquired basic skills.
                         She will know how speak and to communicate. She will be able to pen herself 
                         to others, to appreciate them and to work with them. She will not only have 
                                 
                         acquired knowledge, but also the ‘know-how’ for acquiring more knowledge and
                         developing further skills in the future. She will be confident but not arrogant
                         </p>
                         <h3>Loyalities</h3>
                         <p style="font-size: 15px;">Your daughter will also have certain loyalties.

                         Among these, the first loyalty will be to her religion. We hope, that in all

                          the changes of life, she will never allow Almighty God to disappear from her

                         life. She will also be loyal to her family, her country and her school.

                         These are just some of the characteristics a ‘Jesus & Mary’ pupil, your

                         daughter, will exemplify when she leaves us after twelve years.</p>
